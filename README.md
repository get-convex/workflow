# Convex Workflow (Beta)

This component adds durably executed _workflows_ to Convex. Combine Convex queries, mutations,
and actions into long-lived workflows, and the system will always fully execute a workflow
to completion.

```ts
import { WorkflowManager } from "@convex-dev/workflow";
import { components } from "./_generated/server";

export const workflow = new WorkflowManager(components.workflow);

export const exampleWorkflow = workflow.define({
  args: {
    storageId: v.id("_storage"),
  },
  handler: async (step, args) => {
    const transcription = await step.runAction(
      internal.index.computeTranscription,
      {
        storageId: args.storageId,
      },
    );

    // Sleep for a month after computing the transcription.
    await step.sleep(30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);

    const embedding = await step.runAction(internal.index.computeEmbedding, {
      transcription,
    });
    console.log(embedding);
  },
});
```

This component is currently in beta. It's missing some functionality, but
what's there should work.

## Installation

First, add `@convex-dev/workflow` to your Convex project:

```
npm install @convex-dev/workflow
```

Then, install the component within your `convex/convex.config.ts` file:

```ts
// convex/convex.config.ts
import workflow from "@convex-dev/workflow/component.config.js";
import { defineApp } from "convex/server";

const app = defineApp();
app.use(workflow);
export default app;
```

Finally, create a workflow manager within your `convex/` folder, and point it
to the installed component:

```ts
// convex/index.ts
import { WorkflowManager } from "@convex-dev/workflow";
import { components } from "./_generated/server";

export const workflow = new WorkflowManager(components.workflow);
```

## Usage

The first step is to define a workflow using `workflow.define()`. This function
is designed to feel like a Convex action but with a few restrictions:

1. The workflow can optionally declare an argument validator.
2. The workflow runs in the background, so it can't return a value.
3. The workflow must be _deterministic_, so it should implement most of its logic
   by calling out to other Convex functions. We will be lifting some of these
   restrictions over time by implementing `Math.random()`, `Date.now()`, and
   `fetch` within our workflow environment.

```ts
// convex/index.ts

workflow.define({
  args: {
    storageId: v.id("_storage"),
  },
  handler: async (step, args) => {
    const transcription = await step.runAction(api.index.computeTranscription, {
      storageId: args.storageId,
    });
    const embedding = await step.runAction(api.index.computeEmbedding, {
      transcription,
    });
    console.log(embedding);
  },
});
```

Once you've defined a workflow, you can start it using `workflow.start()`, which
will kick off execution of the workflow and return a `WorkflowId`. You can then query
the status of the workflow with `workflow.status()` or cancel it with `workflow.cancel()`.

```ts
// convex/index.ts

export const workflowExample = mutation(async (ctx) => {
    const workflowId = await workflow.start(ctx, api.index.exampleWorkflow, {
        storageId: ...,
    });
    const status = await workflow.status(ctx, workflowId);
    return status;
});
```

Once a workflow's completed, you can clean it up its storage with `workflow.cleanup()`.

```ts
// convex/index.ts

await workflow.cleanup(ctx, workflowId);
```

## Limitations

Convex workflows is a beta product currently under active development. Here are
a few limitations to keep in mind:

- Steps can only take in and return a total of _1 MiB_ of data within a single
  workflow execution. If you run into journal size limits, you can work around
  this by storing results within your worker functions and then passing IDs
  around within the the workflow.
- `console.log()` isn't currently captured, so you may see duplicate log lines
  within your Convex dashboard.
- We currently do not collect backtraces from within function calls from workflows.
- If you need to use side effects like `fetch`, `Math.random()`, or `Date.now()`,
  you'll need to define a separate Convex action, perform the side effects there,
  and then call that action from the workflow with `step.runAction()`.

# 🧑‍🏫 What is Convex?

[Convex](https://convex.dev) is a hosted backend platform with a
built-in database that lets you write your
[database schema](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas) and
[server functions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions) in
[TypeScript](https://docs.convex.dev/typescript). Server-side database
[queries](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions) automatically
[cache](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions#caching--reactivity) and
[subscribe](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react#reactivity) to data, powering a
[realtime `useQuery` hook](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react#fetching-data) in our
[React client](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react). There are also clients for
[Python](https://docs.convex.dev/client/python),
[Rust](https://docs.convex.dev/client/rust),
[ReactNative](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react-native), and
[Node](https://docs.convex.dev/client/javascript), as well as a straightforward
[HTTP API](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api/).

The database supports
[NoSQL-style documents](https://docs.convex.dev/database/document-storage) with
[opt-in schema validation](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas),
[relationships](https://docs.convex.dev/database/document-ids) and
[custom indexes](https://docs.convex.dev/database/indexes/)
(including on fields in nested objects).

The
[`query`](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions) and
[`mutation`](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions) server functions have transactional,
low latency access to the database and leverage our
[`v8` runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes) with
[determinism guardrails](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#using-randomness-and-time-in-queries-and-mutations)
to provide the strongest ACID guarantees on the market:
immediate consistency,
serializable isolation, and
automatic conflict resolution via
[optimistic multi-version concurrency control](https://docs.convex.dev/database/advanced/occ) (OCC / MVCC).

The [`action` server functions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions) have
access to external APIs and enable other side-effects and non-determinism in
either our
[optimized `v8` runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes) or a more
[flexible `node` runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#nodejs-runtime).

Functions can run in the background via
[scheduling](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions) and
[cron jobs](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/cron-jobs).

Development is cloud-first, with
[hot reloads for server function](https://docs.convex.dev/cli#run-the-convex-dev-server) editing via the
[CLI](https://docs.convex.dev/cli),
[preview deployments](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/preview-deployments),
[logging and exception reporting integrations](https://docs.convex.dev/production/integrations/),
There is a
[dashboard UI](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard) to
[browse and edit data](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/data),
[edit environment variables](https://docs.convex.dev/production/environment-variables),
[view logs](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/logs),
[run server functions](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/functions), and more.

There are built-in features for
[reactive pagination](https://docs.convex.dev/database/pagination),
[file storage](https://docs.convex.dev/file-storage),
[reactive text search](https://docs.convex.dev/text-search),
[vector search](https://docs.convex.dev/vector-search),
[https endpoints](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions) (for webhooks),
[snapshot import/export](https://docs.convex.dev/database/import-export/),
[streaming import/export](https://docs.convex.dev/production/integrations/streaming-import-export), and
[runtime validation](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas#validators) for
[function arguments](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/args-validation) and
[database data](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas#schema-validation).

Everything scales automatically, and it’s [free to start](https://www.convex.dev/plans).
